## Technology Stack Alignment

### Current (Lovable)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Storage: Supabase Storage
- Authentication: Supabase Auth

### Enhanced (Enterprise)
- Container: Docker + Kubernetes
- Infrastructure: Terraform
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Caching: Redis
- Search: Elasticsearch
- Queue: RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Technical KPIs
- API Response Time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database Query Time: < 50ms (average)
- System Uptime: 99.9%
- Error Rate: < 0.1%

### Business KPIs  
- Customer Satisfaction: > 4.5/5
- Vendor Onboarding Time: < 24 hours
- Order Fulfillment Rate: > 98%
- Platform Revenue Growth: 25% YoY

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Migration**: Comprehensive backup and rollback strategies
- **Service Downtime**: Blue-green deployment strategies
- **Performance Degradation**: Load testing and monitoring
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits

### Business Risks
- **Regulatory Changes**: Compliance monitoring system
- **Market Competition**: Feature development roadmap
- **Vendor Relations**: Automated vendor management
- **Customer Experience**: User feedback integration

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Implementation**: Start with Lovable-compatible enhancements
2. **Infrastructure Planning**: Design Kubernetes architecture
3. **Team Training**: Upskill on DevOps practices
4. **Vendor Selection**: Choose monitoring and security tools
5. **Timeline Refinement**: Detailed sprint planning

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to transform the current Lovable project into an enterprise-grade e-commerce platform while maintaining development velocity and system reliability.
