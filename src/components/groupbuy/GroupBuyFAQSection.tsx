      question: "How does group buying work?",
      answer: "Group buying allows multiple people to purchase the same product together to get volume discounts. The more people join the group, the lower the price becomes for everyone."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a group doesn't reach its target?",
      answer: "If a group doesn't reach the minimum number of participants within the time limit, all payments are automatically refunded to participants within 3-5 business days."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I have to wait for my order?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my participation in a group?",

      question: "How do I invite friends to join my group?",
